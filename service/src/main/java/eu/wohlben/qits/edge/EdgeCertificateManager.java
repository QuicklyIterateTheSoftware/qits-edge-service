   * project ever created within a second or two: the first announcement would otherwise order a
   * certificate missing all the others, and the correction would spend one of the five duplicate
   * certificates Let's Encrypt allows per week. The first request opens a window of {@link

   * behind a reconcile is an ACME order with DNS propagation waits in it — minutes, in the worst
   * case, during which no other frame would be delivered. The delayed executor guarantees the
   * separation: this method schedules and returns.
   *
   * <p>The pending flag is cleared before the work rather than after, so a project announced while
   * an order is in flight opens a fresh window instead of being swallowed by the one running.
   *
   * <p><b>A request that loses to a run already in flight RE-ARMS.</b> It used to be dropped, and
   * the boot it was written for is exactly where that cost the most: the startup reconcile holds
   * the guard for as long as an ACME order takes — up to {@link AcmeConfig#dnsTimeout()} — and
   * {@code ProjectSansBootstrap}'s post-catch-up request lands inside that window, so the first
   * certificate carried no project SANs at all until the 12h sweep. The re-arm is bounded by the
