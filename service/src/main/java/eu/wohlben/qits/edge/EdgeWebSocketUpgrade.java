/**
 * The edge's own WebSocket upgrade: handshake against the upstream, splice the two sockets, and —
 * the reason this class exists — <b>give the upstream connection back on every path that does not
 * end in a spliced socket</b>.
 *
 * <p><b>Why not {@code vertx-http-proxy}'s built-in upgrade handling.</b> Its upgrade path assumes
 * an unread inbound request: it registers a body handler on it after opening the upstream side, and
 * {@code Http1xServerRequest} answers that with {@code IllegalStateException: Request has already
 * been read} when the request has already been consumed. Under Quarkus it has been: the inbound
 * request is a {@code ResumingRequestWrapper}, which resumes the paused request on its own account,
 * and a handshake — a bodyless GET — is then read to its end before the proxy runs. The exception
 * is thrown <i>after</i> the upstream accepted the upgrade and <i>before</i> the proxy registers
 * its response handler, so nothing ever touches that connection again: not the pool, which believes
 * it is still in use, and not a close. One pool slot per attempt, gone until restart — at 64, the
 * whole origin hangs, plain GETs included. That is the outage this class replaces.
 *
 * <p>So this path never registers a handler on the inbound request at all. A WebSocket client sends
 * no body and no frame before it has the {@code 101}, so there is nothing to forward until {@link
 * HttpServerRequest#toNetSocket()} — which takes the whole connection over, read state and all.
 * What remains cannot crash on a consumed request, and every failure before the splice closes the
 * upstream connection in a {@code try/catch} that has no other job.
 *
 * <p><b>What an upstream sees is unchanged</b> from the proxy's upgrade path: the inbound headers
 * as {@link EdgeRouter} prepared them — identity asserted, forwarded headers applied, and the
 * credential already rewritten — minus {@code Host}, which the client fills in from the socket it
 * opened, with {@code Connection} normalised to {@code Upgrade}. An upstream that refuses the
 * upgrade answers with its own status; the refusal is relayed as that status and the connection is
 * closed rather than pooled, because a connection that has carried a {@code connect()} handshake is
 * not one this class can prove clean.
 *
 * <p><b>The credential is settled before this class runs, never here.</b> {@link EdgeRouter} calls
 * {@link #handle} only from its proxy step, which runs after {@link EdgeAuth#checkCredential} has
 * passed — and that check rewrites {@code Authorization} on the inbound header map this class
 * copies. So a socket opened with an opaque {@code qits_tok_} value, or with a client id and
 * secret, reaches its upstream carrying {@code Bearer <the JWT it was validated with>}, exactly as
 * a plain request does; and a refused credential is answered 401 before any upstream connection is
 * acquired.
 *
 * <p><b>A socket is acquired from the STREAM pool</b> — {@link EdgeRouter} hands this class that
 * client and its {@link UpstreamPools} — because a terminal holds its connection for as long as
 * somebody is typing into it. Its lease is ended by the channel closing and by nothing else: a
 * spliced socket has no response end, and every exit before the splice closes the connection.
