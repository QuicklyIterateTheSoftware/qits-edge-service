/**
 * The edge's whole configuration surface: which environments exist, which one is the fallback, and
 * and the direct application vhosts it owns.
 *
 * <p>There is no route table and no path knowledge here, deliberately. The edge demultiplexes by
 * <b>host name</b> only — an environment name, and since the ingress campaign an optional
 * application name in front of it. Deployment events own environment-vhost paths; {@link #apps()}
 * maps a whole NAME to a whole service, never a path to one.
 *
 * <p>Every upstream is derived from configuration ONLY. No part of a request selects a host or a
 * port: the Host name picks an environment out of a fixed list, and a name that is not in the list
 * picks the default. That is the SSRF guard, and it is why {@link #environments()} is a list rather
 * than a pattern the request could satisfy.
 *
 * <p>Since config sources include environment variables, a deployment declares all of it without a
 * file:
 *
 * <pre>
 * QITS_DOMAIN=wohlben.eu
 * QITS_EDGE_ENVIRONMENTS=prod,dev
 * QITS_EDGE_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=prod
