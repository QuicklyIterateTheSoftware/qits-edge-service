/**
 * The origin one request's own name is composed against, read off that name and the grammar.
 *
 * <p>{@link HostEnvironments} answers "which place is this name?"; this answers "what do that
 * place's OTHER names look like?" — everything the navigation document and a door's redirect need
 * to write {@code https://ci.dev.acme.example.com} without being told the domain twice.
 *
 * <p><b>The grammar is the router's, spelled forwards.</b> A name is read right to left — {@code
 * <app>[.<env>].<project>.<domain>} — so what is composed is the same shape, built back up from the
 * labels the reading resolved:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   ci.dev.acme.example.com   an app of an env-supporting project -> dev.acme.example.com
 *   dev.acme.example.com      that project's environment door     -> dev.acme.example.com
 *   acme.example.com          that project's own door             -> dev.acme.example.com
 *                                                                    (the DEFAULT environment)
 *   projects.qits.example.com an app of an env-LESS project       -> qits.example.com
 *   qits.example.com          that project's door                 -> qits.example.com
 *   example.com, 127.0.0.1    the apex, an address, no Host       -> the canonical origin, read
 *   dev.nosuchproject.example.com  a project nobody created           the same way
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>The authority is the INNERMOST door, and an app label is one label in front of it.</b> That
 * is the whole contract, and it is one rule rather than two because the grammar nests: an
 * env-supporting project's innermost door is its environment's, an env-less project's is its own,
 * and in both cases an application of it is {@code <app>.} in front. Nothing here prefixes a
 * project label onto anything — the authority already carries it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code supportsEnvironments} decides whether the env label is there at all</b>, and it is
 * read per request from the live projection rather than baked in. The platform's own project is
 * exactly why: it supports environments today, so its addresses are {@code
 * <app>.dev.qits.<domain>}, and they become {@code <app>.qits.<domain>} the moment a {@code
 * ProjectChanged} frame flips the flag. Both are the ordinary behaviour of one rule.
 *
 * <p><b>A name that names no project composes no application name</b>, and says so by answering
 * null from {@link #hostOrigin}. The apex, an address literal, a name outside the domain and a name
 * whose project label names no project all carry no project, and under this grammar there is no
 * application address that does not: every app is inside a project. Such a name falls back to the
 * CANONICAL ORIGIN, read by the same grammar — and that origin is the PLATFORM PROJECT's own door,
 * derived from the stated domain rather than configured, so the apex has a project's tier to
 * compose application names on whenever this edge knows that project. Where it does not, the door
 * says so instead of redirecting somewhere that 404s.
 *
 * <p><b>The port is part of the answer</b>, which is what makes {@code
 * http://ci.dev.acme.localhost:8080} work: a developer's whole platform is one port, so an origin
 * without it names nothing. It is carried with whichever name was read — the request's own, or the
 * canonical origin's when that is what answered.
 *
 * <p><b>The scheme comes from {@code X-Forwarded-Proto} when there is one</b>, because a TLS
 * terminator in front of the edge is the only hop that knows the answer — the same reason {@code
 * EdgeHeaders} sets that header only when it is absent. The FIRST value is read: the header is a
 * list, oldest hop first, and the outermost hop is the one that faced the client.
 *
 * <p>Framework-free and static on purpose, next to {@link HostEnvironments} and for the same
 * reason: this is one of the two pieces of behaviour worth asserting without booting anything, and
 * {@code EnvironmentAuthorityTest} is where the edge cases live.
 *
 * @param scheme {@code http} or {@code https}, whichever faced the client
 * @param authority the innermost door's authority, port and all — never null, because every answer
 *     is an address a browser could be sent to
 * @param project the project that authority is inside, or null when the name named none. It is the
 *     one thing that decides whether an application name can be composed at all.
