/**
 * Where qits-platform-idp is, and what it calls itself — TWO keys, because they are two facts.
 *
 * <p>{@code qits.idp.url} is the {@code iss} every accepted token must carry, exactly: a consumer
 * that validated a token whose issuer differed by one character would be validating somebody
 * else's. It is a string that is COMPARED, and it does not have to resolve.
 *
 * <p>{@code qits.idp.dial-url} is the address this process actually connects to for keys, tokens
 * and introspection. It defaults to the issuer, which is what it was until the platform plane was
 * deleted — one key naming the receiver, every path under it derived here rather than configured,
 * because the paths belong to idp rather than to a deployment. The paths are still derived; what
 * moved is which of the two strings they hang off.
 *
 * <p><b>WHY THEY HAD TO COME APART, and it is not tidiness.</b> Deleting the plane moves every
 * platform service from a bare alias to {@code <env>-<application>}, and the old bare-named swarm
 * services are removed once nothing dials them. Dialling is what this class does three times. The
 * issuer is the one thing that CANNOT move with them: it is stamped into every token in flight and
 * compared for equality by every consumer, so changing it rejects every outstanding token at once,
 * estate-wide. Dual DNS buys a string comparison nothing — so the address moves and the claim
 * stays, which is only expressible once the two stop sharing a key.
 *
 * <p>qits-bootstrap-cli made the same split on its side first, {@code ${IDP}} against {@code
 * ${IDP_DIAL}}, and its AGENTS.md records the rule this class now also holds: DO NOT RE-MERGE THEM.
 * They read identically on a platform that has not cut over, which is exactly how they would get
 * collapsed back into one by somebody tidying up.
