   * nothing under it, and {@code *.<env>.<domain>} only holds where that middle label is an
   * environment. The edge derives a tier per known project for both of the depths a project label
   * makes — see {@code CertificateNames} — so a project's app hosts need no name here at all. What
   * is left for this key is what it always said it was: a list of NAMES, for the ones no tier
   * describes.

   * reaches the certificate at the next order — the 12h reconcile, or a restart at once.

   * second order would draw on Let's Encrypt's production duplicate-certificate limit of five a
   * week. One window covers the whole burst, and the order that follows carries every slug.
   *
   * <p>Thirty seconds is chosen against the two things it trades: an order placed too early is a
   * rate-limited mistake, and an order placed late is a project whose app hosts have no certificate
   * for half a minute longer. There is no key in the bootstrap for it; it is here for an operator
   * who has a reason.
