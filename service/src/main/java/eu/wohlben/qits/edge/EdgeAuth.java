/**
 * idp authentication, terminated at the edge — the first node, which is the whole point.
 *
 * <p>The edge sees every request before anything else does and already reads the Host header, so it
 * is the cheapest place to gate. What it gates is a <b>vhost</b>, never a path: an {@code
 * $app.$env.$domain} name fronts a service with no external auth of its own, so the name is the
 * decision and {@link AuthConfig} is the switch.
 *
 * <p><b>This class is the MACHINE half.</b> A token, or the client id and secret it is minted from.
 * The browser half — a session cookie, on a service's own name — is {@link EdgeSessions}, and it
 * calls back into this one: a machine credential presented there is checked by exactly these rules,
 * so a commissioned client that works today keeps working when the browser gate is turned on.
 *
 * <h2>The docker half</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code docker login} stores a password and resends it forever, while an idp token lives ~300
 * seconds and cannot be refreshed. The Distribution spec's own answer is the <b>Bearer token
 * endpoint</b> flow, and it is the one this implements:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>docker asks for something and gets {@link #challenge a 401} naming a {@code realm};
 *   <li>docker GETs that realm with HTTP Basic — the idp CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET a user stored
 *       with {@code docker login}, which is the durable credential;
 *   <li>{@link #token} brokers a {@code client_credentials} grant to idp over qits-net and hands
 *       back a short-lived token, docker-style;
 *   <li>docker retries with {@code Authorization: Bearer …}, and re-fetches when it expires.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The token itself is validated OFFLINE against idp's published keys ({@link IdpKeys}), so idp
 * is on the login path and not on the per-pull path.
 *
 * <p>An opaque {@code qits_tok_} value stored with {@code docker login -u token -p qits_tok_…} is
 * the one realm credential that is not a client secret: step 3 introspects it instead of granting,
 * and hands docker the JWT it stands for ({@link #realmToken}).
 *
 * <h2>The other half: clients that cannot do the dance</h2>
 *
 * <p>maven, npm and git send HTTP Basic and nothing else — there is no client in any of them that
 * reads a {@code WWW-Authenticate: Bearer} challenge, fetches a token and retries. So a gated
 * request carrying {@code Authorization: Basic} is validated the only way a client id and secret
 * can be: by spending them at idp ({@link IdpGrants}) and reading the token that comes back. What
 * happens next is the Bearer path exactly — same issuer, same expiry, same signature, same demanded
 * audience — so a commissioned client opens precisely the vhosts its audiences name and no others.
 *
 * <p><b>One audience opens every vhost:</b> {@link AuthConfig#platformAudience()}. A token that
 * names it passes on every path above, next to the vhost's own audience. Its roles are the
 * permission, and the services check them.
 *
 * <p><b>And what goes on upstream is the TOKEN, never the pair.</b> A service one hop in cannot
 * check a secret, so a relayed {@code Basic} tells it nothing but "the edge was satisfied" — it
 * cannot tell a CI run's credential from an agent's, and it is holding a client secret it has no
 * business holding. So an accepted client id and secret leaves here as {@code Bearer <the token it
 * was validated with>}, exactly as git's {@code oauth2:} pair does: the service's own OIDC
 * mechanism validates the JWT independently and builds the roles from its claims, and the secret
 * stops at this process.
 *
 * <p><b>The result is cached against a HASH of the credential</b>, never the credential, for the
 * shorter of the minted token's usable life and {@link AuthConfig#basicCacheTtlMs()}. Without it
 * every dependency fetch would put an idp round trip on the path, which is the thing offline
 * validation exists to avoid. The minted token is held with it, because a hit with nothing to
 * forward would be a request quietly downgraded to anonymous. Refusals are not cached — see {@link
 * #checkBasic}.
 *
 * <h2>The third credential: an opaque token</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@code qits_tok_…} value ({@link TokenValue}) is neither a JWT nor a client secret. It is a
 * row at idp, which is the point — it can be deleted — and so this process cannot decide anything
 * about it alone. It asks idp's {@code /api/tokens/introspect} ({@link #checkToken}), receives the
 * ordinary JWT the token currently stands for, holds that JWT to exactly the Bearer rules above,
 * and forwards IT: an upstream never sees a token, only a JWT its own OIDC mechanism already
 * validates. A token is never parsed as a JWT and a JWT is never sent to introspection; the prefix
 * tells them apart before either path begins. idp's answer is cached per token for {@link
 * AuthConfig#tokenCacheTtlMs()} — refusals included — which is the whole of a revoked token's
 * afterlife here.
 *
 * <h2>The one gap in a gated vhost</h2>
 *
 * <p>A vhost is the decision, but not every METHOD on it has to be. {@link
 * AuthConfig#anonymousReadApps()} names app labels whose {@code GET} and {@code HEAD} pass without
 * a credential, because reads are the bootstrap steps — pulling a base image, cloning, fetching a
 * dependency — that happen before there is anything to hold a token. Writes on the same name keep
 * the whole check, so the exemption cannot widen into "this service is public".
 *
 * <p>docker's {@code service} and {@code scope} query parameters are read and dropped. The
 * permission is the audience the token already carries; per-repository grants would be a change to
 * the platform's claim model, not to this class.
