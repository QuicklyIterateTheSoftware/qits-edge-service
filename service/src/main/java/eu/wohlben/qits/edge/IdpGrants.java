/**
 * The one place this process asks qits-idp for a token, and the patience it asks with.
 *
 * <p><b>Why patience is a feature and not a nicety.</b> idp is a container like any other and is
 * redeployed like any other: for a few seconds its name resolves to an address that refuses, drops
 * or accepts-and-never-answers. Every one of those seconds used to be an outage of the edge's whole
 * auth surface — on 2026-08-14 a deploy push died with "the identity provider could not be reached"
 * because a grant landed inside that window. A client that is told "no" retries the WHOLE push; a
 * client that is made to wait two seconds does not notice.
 *
 * <p><b>Bounded on both sides.</b> Each attempt carries a timeout, so an address that accepts a
 * connection and then says nothing — what a service VIP does while its task is starting — fails
 * rather than waiting with nothing to end it, and the whole sequence is bounded by a window, so a
 * caller always gets an answer. Without the per-attempt timeout there is no answer at all: no
 * status and no body until the inbound connection's own idle timeout closes it an hour later, and a
 * docker client has no timeout of its own on a realm call — it waits.
 *
 * <p><b>An ANSWER is never retried.</b> Only the connection is. A 400 or a 401 from idp is idp
 * deciding, and repeating the question would turn one refusal into a burst of them.
