 *
 * <p>PostgreSQL is a cache of this projection, not proof that it is current: a newer {@code
 * DeploymentActive} can have been published while this edge was down. At startup this coordinator
 * therefore holds readiness down and keeps direct path routing disabled until the eventstream
 * reader reports that {@link DeploymentActiveSubscriber#CONSUMER_ID} reached a page whose explicit
 * next cursor was absent. It retries indefinitely: qits-events being briefly down must not turn a
 * recoverable boot race into a permanently stale edge.
