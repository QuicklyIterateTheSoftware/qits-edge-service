/**
 * Readiness: this edge has rebuilt its deployment routing projection.
 *
 * <p>It deliberately does not probe application endpoints: an edge whose downstream is down is
 * still correctly configured, and restarting it for that outage would make recovery worse.
 *
 * <p>DOWN until the head, even while the stored snapshot is served ({@code serving-snapshot}): that
 * is a fallback, not a caught-up edge. Nothing routes on this check (qits-2160) — swarm's
 * healthcheck is {@code /q/health/live}, because a not-ready edge must still receive traffic: the
 * catch-up barrier lives in the router, not in swarm's routing mesh.
