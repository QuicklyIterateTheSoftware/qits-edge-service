/**
 * The edge itself: one catch-all Vert.x route that reads the Host name, picks an environment, and
 * streams each admitted exchange to a deployment-published endpoint or configured application.
 *
 * <p><b>What this does not do</b> is still most of what makes it worth having. It holds no route
 * table beyond the deployment projection and application list, rewrites no path, reads no body, and
 * serves nothing of its own but {@code /q}, {@code /main-navigation} and an admitted origin's CORS
 * preflight — see {@link EdgeCors}, which owns CORS on every service host.
 *
 * <p><b>A name reaches a service two ways now.</b> {@code qits.edge.apps} is the configured one and
 * is a deployment fact — the machine vhosts, and the auth attributes that go with them. The
 * projection is the other: a deployment publishes the public name its service answers to, and
 * {@code <app>.<env>.<domain>} then serves that service's SPA at {@code /} and every wire route it
 * owns. They are the same kind of vhost, so a request to either is gated per request rather than
 * per plane: a machine credential, then a browser session, then the reads the deployment opened.
 * Either way the hostname alone picks the application: a path on a service's name is resolved among
 * that service's own routes only, and a call to another application is a cross-origin call to that
 * application's own name, whose CORS the edge answers — see {@link #upstreamOf} and {@link
 * EdgeCors}.
 *
 * <p><b>A door serves nothing, and there are three of them.</b> The apex, a project's own name
 * {@code <project>.<domain>}, and an environment's name inside a project {@code
 * <env>.<project>.<domain>} each answer {@code GET /} with a redirect to the projects host and 404
 * every other path — see {@link #door}. They route nothing, gate nothing and proxy nothing, so a
 * service is reachable on its own name alone.
 *
 * <p><b>The grammar is read right to left and the project label is mandatory.</b> {@code
 * <app>[.<env>].<project>.<domain>} — see {@link HostEnvironments}, which holds the whole of it.
 * What is joined on here is what a deployment published, which is the one thing that class cannot
 * know, and the apex is no longer rescued here at all: the domain is stated, so the reading finds
 * it positionally like every other name.
 *
 * <p><b>Streaming is the reason for the shape.</b> {@code vertx-http-proxy} never buffers a request
 * or response body, so the platform's SSE channels, its {@code git clone}s and its OCI layer pushes
 * all pass through unchanged; a WebSocket upgrade — every interactive terminal — is spliced by
 * {@link EdgeWebSocketUpgrade}, the edge's own path, for the reasons written there. A JAX-RS layer
 * would buffer and re-encode all four.
 *
 * <p><b>Security posture.</b> The upstream host and port come from configuration or from the
 * deployment projection only. A Host name selects an <i>index into a fixed list</i> and never
 * contributes a character to an address, so there is no name a client can send that reaches a host
 * neither the deployment nor a deployed service named. An unmatched name is not an error — it is
 * the default environment.
