/**
 * The whole of the edge's routing logic: a Host name in, a {@link Route} out.
 *
 * <p><b>The grammar is read RIGHT TO LEFT, and every label is inside the one to its right:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;app&gt; [ .&lt;env&gt; ] .&lt;project&gt; .&lt;domain&gt;
 *
 *   wohlben.eu                     the apex, which serves nothing
 *   qits.wohlben.eu                the qits project's door
 *   projects.qits.wohlben.eu       an app of the qits project, which supports no environments
 *   editor.qits.wohlben.eu         the editor — an app of qits, like any other
 *   someproject.wohlben.eu         another project's door
 *   dev.someproject.wohlben.eu     that project's dev environment door
 *   ci.dev.someproject.wohlben.eu  an app of that project, in dev
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The domain holds projects, a project holds its environments, an environment holds its apps.
 * The reading is POSITIONAL: a label's meaning is decided by where it sits, never by which
 * configured set it happens to belong to. That retired every tie-break this class used to carry —
 * an app called {@code prod}, a project called {@code registry} and an environment called {@code
 * acme} are now three ordinary names that collide with nothing, because no two of them are ever
 * read at the same position.
 *
 * <p><b>The project label is mandatory, and that is what makes the grammar unambiguous.</b> There
 * is no unqualified application tier: the platform is simply the project called {@code qits}, so
 * {@code projects.qits.wohlben.eu} is an app of a project exactly as {@code ci.dev.acme.wohlben.eu}
 * is, and an app name can never structurally collide with a project slug. A name with its project
 * label missing is a name with a label missing — an ordinary 404, with no refusal of its own.
 *
 * <p><b>The env label is present exactly when the project supports environments.</b> That is a
 * property of the project, projected from qits-projects onto {@code EdgeProjects}, so the second
 * label from the right is an environment for one project and an application for the next. It is not
 * guessed from the environment list: a project with environments and a name whose env label is not
 * one of them is a 404, and an env-less project's apps are served in the default environment.
 *
 * <p><b>Positional reading needs the domain STATED.</b> It cannot be derived — {@code
 * example.co.uk} is two labels of domain and {@code localhost} is one — so it is a value, and it is
 * stated once as {@code qits.edge.domain} ({@code QITS_DOMAIN}), which {@code EdgeRouter} reads
 * directly. An address literal, a missing Host header and the domain itself carry no position at
 * all, and all three are answered as the apex is: a door, which serves nothing — that is how the
 * platform is reached before DNS exists.
 *
 * <p><b>A name OUTSIDE the stated domain is a MACHINE NAME, and it is read too.</b> The platform's
 * own machine vhosts are docker network aliases of this container and are deliberately not under
 * the public domain — {@code registry.dev.localhost:8080} is in every image reference, {@code
 * mirror.dev.localhost:8080} in every maven build, {@code githost.dev.localhost:8080} and {@code
 * githost.dev.internal:8080} in every clone from a container — so refusing them takes docker pulls,
 * dependency resolution and container git down together, which is what happened when this class
 * first read the domain. Such a name is therefore read as {@code <app>[.<env>].<machine-suffix>}:
 * the leftmost label is joined against the configured application set exactly as an app label under
 * the domain is, an environment label may follow it, and everything after that is a suffix nobody
 * here enumerates — {@code localhost}, {@code internal}, and whatever else somebody aliases this
 * container as.
 *
 * <p>Two things that reading is NOT. It is not a revival of the tie-breaks the positional grammar
 * retired: under the stated domain the project label stays mandatory and every label keeps being
 * read by position alone, so {@code registry.dev.<domain>} is the 404 it became and no machine
 * reading rescues it. And it carries no project — there is no project tier in a name outside the
 * domain and there never can be — so {@link Route#project()} is null, {@code EnvironmentAuthority}
 * composes nothing from it, and a leading {@link #LANDING} label, which means a project's root, is
 * {@link Reading#UNKNOWN_MACHINE_NAME} rather than an address. A machine name whose leftmost label
 * no application claims is that same 404, and a machine name of a single label — {@code localhost},
 * this container's own service alias — has no app label in it at all and stays a door.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code landing} is a reserved label: it means THIS PROJECT'S ROOT.</b> A deployable writes
 * {@code host: landing} in its {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} and the deployment it publishes
 * answers the project's own door — {@code <project>.<domain>} — rather than a name of its own. The
 * door is the front of the product, and what answers there is an ordinary deployment.
 *
 * <p>Three consequences, and all three are positional:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a project door whose environment has a landing publisher is an APPLICATION position, not a
 *       door. The label is joined on exactly as an app label is — see {@code landingEnvironments}
 *       below and {@code EdgeRouter.target}, which resolves it against the same projection.
 *   <li>{@code landing.<project>.<domain>} is NOT a second address for it. A reserved label at an
 *       app position is {@link Reading#RESERVED_LABEL}, which is a 404: a thing that already has an
 *       address does not get a second origin, a second cookie scope and a second thing to keep in
 *       step.
 *   <li>where nothing published it, the door is a door and the built-in redirect stays.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here asks what KIND of repository published the name. {@code <project>-landing-app}
 * and {@code <project>-landing-service} claim the door identically, because both publish the same
 * label and the label is all that reaches the wire — the convention is held by naming and review.
 *
 * <p><b>An app label is refused when nothing serves it.</b> The last two readings above are aimed
 * at a service, and services are the names the edge authenticates. A fall-through would hand
 * exactly those requests to a hop that does not authenticate them, so an unconfigured app label is
 * {@link Route#unknownApp() unroutable} here and the caller joins the deployment projection on
 * before answering 404. This is a security property rather than a nicety.
 *
 * <p><b>The project projection is a per-call parameter</b> rather than state. It is live — {@code
 * EdgeProjects} projects it from qits-projects' event stream — and this class stays static and
 * framework-free, exactly as the deployment projection is joined on outside it rather than here.
 *
 * <p><b>An unknown project is a name whose answer changes once the projection catches up.</b> It is
 * the one reading that does, now that the grammar is positional: every other label is read by
 * position and nothing the projection learns can move it. {@link Reading#UNKNOWN_PROJECT} is
 * therefore what {@code EdgeRouter} holds back behind {@code ProjectSansBootstrap}'s barrier, and
 * there is no separate sensitivity question to ask any more.
 *
 * <p>Framework-free on purpose: this is the one piece of behaviour worth unit-testing without
 * booting an application, and {@code HostEnvironmentsTest} is where the readings are pinned.

   * <p>The environment label is optional and is read only when a suffix follows it, so {@code
   * registry.dev.localhost} is dev's registry while {@code mirror.localhost} is the mirror in the
   * default environment — which is right for a platform service deployed once, and is the same
   * default an env-less project's applications get under the domain.
