/**
 * Browser sessions, terminated at the edge — the other half of {@link EdgeAuth}, for the caller
 * that has no client id and cannot be given one.
 *
 * <p><b>The cookie is opaque and idp is the truth.</b> {@code qits-session} carries 256 random
 * bits; idp stores their fingerprint against a row. So this process cannot decide anything about a
 * session on its own — it asks, and caches the answer. The alternative, a signed cookie verified
 * offline against the JWKS this process already holds, would cost revocation: a logout would be a
 * row idp changed and nobody read. What that choice costs instead is an idp round trip, which the
 * cache below pays for once per session per {@link SessionsConfig#cacheTtlMs()}.
 *
 * <h2>A gated request, in five steps</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link EdgeRouter} runs them on a service's own host, and only while {@link
 * SessionsConfig#enabled()}. The environment vhost is the door: it serves nothing, so it gates
 * nothing. A CONFIGURED application vhost with no published host is untouched by every line here —
 * it fronts a service no browser talks to, and its gate is {@link AuthConfig}'s.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Every inbound {@code X-Qits-*} header is dropped. See {@link EdgeHeaders#applyIdentity}.
 *   <li>A {@code Bearer} or {@code Basic} machine credential takes {@link EdgeAuth}'s path exactly,
 *       and is proxied with NO identity headers — a machine's identity is in its token, and writing
 *       a username for it would invent one.
 *   <li>A session cookie is introspected here and becomes the three identity headers.
 *   <li>A path under {@link SessionsConfig#anonymousPrefixes()} is proxied anonymously — the login
 *       page has to be reachable by someone who cannot log in yet.
 *   <li>Anything else is refused: a navigation is sent to the login page — which lives on the host
 *       of whichever deployment owns {@link SessionsConfig#loginPath()} — and everything else gets
 *       a 401. See {@link #refuse}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>The two things the cache is for</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Not putting idp on every request's path</b>, which is the ordinary reason, and <b>outliving
 * an idp that is being replaced</b>, which is the reason that was learnt the hard way: the token
 * broker died inside an idp redeploy on 2026-08-14. A machine retries a push and nobody notices; a
 * person is logged out mid-click. So within {@link SessionsConfig#staleGraceMs()} of a cached
 * session's freshness running out, an idp that cannot be reached AT ALL leaves the belief standing.
 * An idp that answers "no" does not — that is a decision, and it is obeyed at once.
 *
 * <p>Refusals are never cached, for the same reason {@link EdgeAuth} does not cache one: the case
 * it would speed up is a caller whose session was just created, which would then keep being refused
 * after the login it just completed.
