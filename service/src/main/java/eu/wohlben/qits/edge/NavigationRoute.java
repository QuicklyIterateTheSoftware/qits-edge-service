/**
 * The platform navigation, derived from the active deployment projection rather than a gateway enum
 * — on every vhost, because every service's shell renders the same tree.
 *
 * <p><b>Slots, not a list.</b> Each entry says WHERE it hangs in the shell's tree and the shell
 * decides what hangs there; the edge knows nothing about projects or repositories. Every slot of
 * the closed vocabulary is present, empty ones included, so a shell iterates the document rather
 * than a copy of the vocabulary.
 *
 * <p><b>A slot is an ARRAY, and one application may fill several of its entries.</b> The loop below
 * copies every placement of a slot in the order {@link EdgeRoutes#navigation} sorted it — slot,
 * position, label, application — and nothing here is keyed by application, so two rows of one
 * application under the project node come out as two entries with one origin and two subpaths. A
 * repeated position is an ordinary tie broken by label, whether the two entries belong to one
 * application or to two.
 *
 * <p>The document is {@code environment}, {@code origin}, {@code projectOrigin}, {@code slots} and
 * {@code applications}, and nothing else. There is no flat list and no synthesized {@code Home}:
 * the environment's own door is qits-projects' {@code system} entry, which is a deployment fact
 * like every other entry here. {@code origin} is that door — it names the environment, and the door
 * serves nothing else.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code projectOrigin} is the origin a per-project name is built on</b>: prefix {@code
 * <app>.} onto its authority and that is where that application serves this project, {@code
 * https://ci.dev.acme.example.com}. ONE label — the project label is inside the authority already,
 * because a name is read right to left and every address this edge composes is inside a project. It
 * is equal to {@code origin} and is published anyway, because it is the FIELD that is the contract
 * rather than the value. It exists because the client side derived this name itself twice and
 * shipped two domain-derivation bugs doing it (editor-origin.ts): the server states the authority,
 * and the client's whole job is to put {@code <app>.} in front of it.
 *
 * <p><b>An entry's origin is null on a name that is inside no project</b> — the apex, an address
 * literal, a name outside the domain — because an application address needs a project label and
 * such a name carries none; a link that would 404 is worse than an absent one. {@code origin} and
 * {@code projectOrigin} are then the canonical origin, which is a door like the name asked on. No
 * shell reads the document there: every one of those names is a door, and a door serves no SPA.
 *
 * <p>{@code applications} is per-application metadata rather than a placement: one object per
 * application that published a host or an api-docs path, keyed by application name. {@code origin}
 * is the application's own name as an origin — null on a name inside no project, like an entry's —
 * for every application with a published host, navigation entries or not: it is where a shell reads
 * that application's API now that a hostname alone picks the application. {@code apiDocs} is served
 * on that same host, so a shell page composes it against {@code origin} rather than against the
 * door.
