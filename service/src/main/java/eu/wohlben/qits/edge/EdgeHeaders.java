/**
 * Everything the edge does to a request: two things always, and a third while the session gate is
 * on.
 *
 * <p><b>1. It keeps the client's Host.</b> {@code vertx-http-proxy} leaves a proxied request's
 * authority unset, and the Vert.x client then fills the {@code Host} header in from the socket it
 * opened — so without this the environment gateway would see {@code prod-qits-gateway:8080} for
 * every request and never learn the name the browser typed. That name is what any redirect, cookie
 * domain or absolute URL it generates has to be built from, so losing it breaks all three at once
 * and leaves nothing in a log to say why. Measured on Vert.x 4.5.26 against a real upstream, not
 * assumed: {@code EdgeRoutingTest.theOriginalHostReachesTheUpstream} is the regression.
 *
 * <p><b>2. It describes the original client</b> with three headers, each set <b>only when
 * absent</b>: {@code X-Forwarded-For}, {@code X-Forwarded-Host} and {@code X-Forwarded-Proto}.
 *
 * <p>Set-if-absent, not set. qits-gateway overwrites the same names because it is the outermost hop
 * and an inbound value can only be client-supplied. The edge is not always outermost: a TLS
 * terminator may sit in front of it, and that terminator is the only hop that can tell the truth
 * about {@code https}. Overwriting there would replace a true value with a false one. What it costs
 * is that a direct client can supply its own — which is why nothing may make a trust decision on
 * these three, and nothing does: they are diagnostics and link generation. What authentication the
 * edge does make a decision on is the bearer token, which is signed — see {@code EdgeAuth}.
 *
 * <p><b>3. It keeps the {@code X-Qits-*} namespace honest</b> on <b>every</b> request that leaves
 * this process — see {@link #applyIdentity}, called unconditionally from {@code EdgeRouter.proxy}.
 * The strip is what makes a forward-auth service's trust in {@code X-Qits-User} sound, so it cannot
 * be conditional on there being a validated session to replace the value with: a machine credential
 * and a deployment-opened read carry no session and must still not be allowed to forge an identity.
 * A session's own identity is written back after the strip and only then; a request without one has
 * the namespace emptied and no person asserted, its identity being whatever its token proves. The
 * calling application, {@link #CALLER}, is written back the same way whenever the page the request
 * came from is one of the platform's own, session or not. The gateway one hop in still does its
 * own, and has to: a request may reach it from qits-net without passing this process at all.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing else is touched.</b> No header outside the reserved prefix is stripped, no path is
 * rewritten, no body is read. {@code Authorization} and every custom header pass through as they
 * arrived. The one addition is the named browser-session cookie on a session-less path; {@link
 * #stripCookie} removes only that pair and preserves the rest.
 *
 * <p>{@code ProxyInterceptor} has no single abstract method, so this is a class rather than a
 * lambda. Nothing about it is environment-specific, so one instance is shared by every proxy.
