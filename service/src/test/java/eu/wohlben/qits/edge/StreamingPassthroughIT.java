/**
 * <b>The two planes that are not a request and a response</b> — a connection held open in both
 * directions, and an answer written over time — and they are the reason this service has the shape
 * it has.
 *
 * <p>There is no REST layer here and no JAX-RS: a framework that read a body would buffer and
 * re-encode every one of these. {@code vertx-http-proxy} streams instead, and an upgrade is spliced
 * by {@code EdgeWebSocketUpgrade}, the edge's OWN path. Every interactive terminal on the platform,
 * every SSE channel, every {@code git clone} and every OCI layer push goes over one of these two.
 *
 * <p><b>The socket half is the sharpest forward-auth claim this repository can make, and it belongs
 * here rather than with the ordinary strip story.</b> An upgrade never reaches the interceptor
 * chain — {@code EdgeWebSocketUpgrade} rebuilds the handshake by hand and forwards the INBOUND
 * request's header map — so it is a second code path with its own way of losing the strip, and it
 * is the path a forged {@code X-Qits-User} used to cross this process on. Proving it means a real
 * upgrade, through a launched artifact, to a service that records what its handshake carried; a
 * canned-JSON stand-in cannot speak the protocol at all, which is one of the four reasons {@link
 * StoryUpstream} exists.
 *
 * <p><b>It also pins a KNOWN GAP rather than papering over it.</b> The upgrade path drops the
 * client's {@code Host} — the outbound client fills it in from the socket it opened — so an
 * upstream reads the name the browser typed from {@code X-Forwarded-Host} and not from {@code
 * Host}. That is asserted below in both directions: the forwarded header is right, and the {@code
 * Host} header is NOT the vhost. It costs nothing today because a handshake's {@code Host} is a
 * protocol formality rather than something a service routes on, and it is written into README.md as
 * a known gap. A story that quietly asserted only the half that works would be how it stopped being
 * known.
 *
 * <p><b>The streaming half cannot be proved by a body.</b> A proxy that buffered delivers exactly
 * the same bytes; only WHEN the first of them arrives tells the two apart, so the assertion is a
 * clock and the stand-in writes its answer in two halves with a gap between them.

      """
      A terminal is one dialled connection carrying a stream in both directions, with no request
      boundary anywhere inside it. It is how an operator gets a shell in a container, and it is the
      one plane on this platform where "the front door asserts who you are" has a second
      implementation.

      An upgrade does not go through the reverse proxy at all. It takes a path of this process's
      own — the built-in one assumed an unread request, threw mid-upgrade after the upstream had
      already accepted it, and leaked a pool slot per attempt until the whole origin hung — and
      that path rebuilds the handshake by hand from the inbound headers. Which means the strip has
      to happen before it, on the inbound map, or it does not happen at all. It used to not happen
      at all: an upgrade was how a forged `X-Qits-User` reached the hop behind this one.

      So the operator opens a terminal with a real session and the same four forged headers as
      every other story here. The socket comes up, the service pushes a frame down it, and the
      service's recording of the HANDSHAKE — which is the only place this is visible — shows the
      identity idp vouched for and none of her forgeries.

      One thing it also shows is a gap, stated rather than hidden: the upgrade path drops the
      client's `Host`, so the upstream reads the name she typed from `X-Forwarded-Host` and finds a
      loopback address in `Host`. It costs nothing today, because a handshake's `Host` is a
      formality and nothing routes on it one hop further in. It is asserted both ways round here so
      that it stays a known gap rather than becoming a surprise.
