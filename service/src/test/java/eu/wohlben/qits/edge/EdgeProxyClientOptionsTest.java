/**
 * The proxy client's two timeouts, which pull in opposite directions and are each a real outage
 * when they are wrong.
 *
 * <p>Framework-free on purpose: the options object is what {@code EdgeRouter.init} hands {@code
 * createHttpClient}, so reading it back proves the wiring without booting the application — and
 * without the second Quarkus start that {@code EdgeRoutingTest} cannot afford.
 *
 * <p>Behaviour is not asserted here. A real connect timeout needs an address that black-holes the
 * SYN, and a blackhole answers differently in different network namespaces — the flip proof on
 * swarm is where that belongs.
