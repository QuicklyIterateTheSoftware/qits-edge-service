/**
 * <b>A service that is not there is an ANSWER, not a wait.</b>
 *
 * <p>This process binds the host's only published port, so every failure mode it has is the
 * platform's failure mode. The one that costs most is not an error — it is silence: a request that
 * queues behind something and is never answered leaves a browser spinning, a {@code docker pull}
 * stalled and nothing in a log naming what it was waiting for. This repository has paid for that
 * twice: a Vert.x client pool that defaults to five connections behind an UNBOUNDED wait queue, so
 * one {@code docker push} starved a whole environment with nothing logged; and an upgrade path that
 * leaked a pool slot per attempt until all sixty-four were gone and plain GETs hung too. Both fixes
 * are bounds — {@code maxPoolSize}, {@code maxWaitQueueSize}, {@code ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS} — and a
 * bound is only worth anything if the thing it bounds ends in a status code.
 *
 * <p><b>Two shapes of "not there", because they fail in two different places.</b> An address
 * nothing listens on is refused at connect, before a byte is written — the failure is in {@code
 * EdgeRouter.origin}, which is also the one line that logs which origin it was. A service that
 * accepted the connection and then went away is a failure mid-exchange, after the request has been
 * forwarded; the far side's own recording proves it arrived, and the caller is still answered.
 *
 * <p><b>The recovery beat is the one that makes the other two mean something.</b> An edge that
 * answered 502 to everything would pass both refusals. So the same name, the same cookie and the
 * same path are asked for again once the service is back, and the 200 says the outage cost the
 * route nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>The arm is cleared in a finally and again in {@code @AfterEach}</b>, because a stand-in
 * left dropping would fail every story after this one with a symptom that names none of them.

      """
      Containers are replaced. For a few seconds a name refuses, drops, or accepts a connection and
      then says nothing at all — and this process is in front of every one of them, holding the
      host's only published port. What it does in those seconds is the whole difference between an
      outage somebody can read and an outage that looks like the platform hanging.

      A person reloads a page while her service is being replaced. The request reaches the
      container — its own recording proves that, and the recording is written before the connection
      goes away, because a recording written afterwards would miss exactly this exchange — and then
      there is nothing on the wire. The edge asks once more, on a fresh connection, because a GET
      that never got an answer is safe to send twice and a replaced container's successor is
      usually already up behind the same name. Here the stand-in drops that one too, so she is
      answered anyway: a 502, promptly, which her browser can show and her SPA can retry.

      A moment later the container is back, and the same name with the same cookie serves the same
      path. That beat is what gives the other two their meaning: a door that answered 502 to
      everything would have passed them both.

      And a name that was configured to point at something which has never been there at all fails
      earlier, at connect, before a byte is written. It is deliberately NOT the same as a name
      nobody claims — that one is a 404, because nobody ever said it was a service. This one is
      somebody's, and the somebody is missing.

      Both refusals are answers. Neither of them is silence, and silence is the failure this
      service's two bounded pools and its acquisition timeout exist to make impossible.
