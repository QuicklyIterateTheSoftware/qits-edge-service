/**
 * Everything behind the edge, stubbed: two environment gateways, the same two environments' {@code
 * registry} and {@code mirror} applications, and a stand-in qits-platform-idp. Each on an ephemeral
 * loopback port. No docker, no fixture and no fixed port — the whole suite runs from a clone of
 * this repository alone.
 *
 * <p>The gateways are <b>two</b> rather than one so that "the edge chose the right environment" is
 * observable from the outside: each server names itself in every answer, so a test asserts which
 * process received the request rather than only that something did. The application upstreams are
 * two per app for the same reason — an app name has to reach ITS environment's copy. Their
 * addresses reach the route table as {@code qits.edge.apps.<app>.hosts.<env>} overrides — the one
 * config path that exists for exactly this — and, for the two servers this class still calls
 * "gateways", as the suite's OWN {@code qits.test.environment-upstreams.<env>} key, which the tests
 * read to build a deployment endpoint with. The name is historical: there is no per-environment
 * gateway on the platform any more, and these two are simply the far side a projected deployment
 * endpoint points at.
 *
 * <p><b>The applications are two so the auth gate has two answers.</b> {@code mirror} is named in
 * {@code qits.edge.auth.anonymous-read-apps} and {@code registry} is not, so one suite covers both
 * a vhost whose reads are open and a vhost that is gated on every method — with the same upstream
 * shape behind each, so the difference asserted is the edge's decision and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Vert.x rather than a JDK {@code HttpServer}, because one server has to answer three shapes an
 * edge must pass through unchanged: an ordinary request with a body, a chunked response written
 * over time, and a WebSocket upgrade. A JDK {@code HttpServer} cannot do the third at all.
 *
 * <p>The stub idp answers the three paths the edge derives from {@code qits.idp.url}: {@code
 * /idp/jwks} publishes {@link TestTokens}' key, {@code /idp/token} issues one for the clients
 * below, and {@code /idp/api/sessions/introspect} answers for the browser sessions. It exists so
 * the auth gate is exercised end to end — a real RS256 signature, a real key fetch, a real broker
 * hop and a real introspection — rather than against a validator that was told to say yes.
 *
 * <p><b>Three sessions, because a cookie has three answers.</b> One is live, one is expired and one
 * starts live and can be {@link #revoke revoked} while the suite runs — which is what proves a
 * revocation is obeyed within the cache's own window rather than at the end of it. {@link
 * #introspections()} counts the calls, so a cache hit is provable by the call that did not happen.
 *
 * <p><b>Three clients, because a credential has three answers.</b> One is commissioned for both
 * environments' registries, one is commissioned for something else entirely — the client that is
 * genuine and still opens nothing here — and one is a black hole the stub accepts and never
 * answers, which is the shape a redeploying idp takes and the only way to prove that the edge
 * answers anyway. {@link #idpDown} and {@link #idpUp} add the fourth shape, a refused connection.
 * One more client, {@link #PLATFORM_ID}, holds only the platform audience, which opens every vhost.
 * And {@link #BRIEF_ID} is the fifth shape: commissioned exactly as the first, but issued a token
 * with barely any life left — the credential whose acceptance the edge may not cache, because what
 * a cache entry holds is the token it would forward.
 *
 * <p><b>And one opaque token, {@link #TOKEN}</b>, which {@code /idp/api/tokens/introspect} stands
 * for a JWT this stub mints on the spot — and which can be {@link #revokeToken revoked} mid-suite.
 * Every other {@code qits_tok_} value is unknown. {@link #tokenIntrospections()} counts the calls,
 * so a cached answer — a yes or a no — is provable by the call that did not happen.
