/**
 * <b>Nothing a caller with no credential sends leaves this process — and that is a claim about
 * traffic which did not happen, so it is the one story in this catalogue whose paying assertions

 *
 * <p>Every service behind this door has no external authentication of its own. It reads {@code
 * X-Qits-User} and believes it, and it answers whatever arrives. So a request that reaches an
 * upstream is a request that has been authorised, whatever it turns out to ask for — which makes
 * "it did not reach the upstream" the whole of what a refusal means here. A 401 whose body still
 * reached the service would be a leak with a green status code.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code assertNoEdgesTo} pays here, and it only pays because the far side is UP.</b> All
 * three services and the identity provider are running and answering throughout this story — the
 * one before it and the one after it both get 200s out of them — so an empty arrow set is a
 * statement about this process's decisions rather than about a fixture that was switched off.
 * {@code assertNoEdgesFrom(qits-edge)} says the same thing once, in the strongest form the
 * framework has: <i>nothing left this process at all</i>.
 *
 * <p><b>Four kinds of caller meet the wall, because a wall that answers everybody the same way is
 * useless.</b> A browser navigating can render a login page and is sent to one. A logged-out tab's
 * background {@code fetch} cannot render anything and must not be handed a {@code Basic} challenge
 * — the browser would answer that with its own credential dialog, over whatever page the person is
 * looking at. A WebSocket handshake is the same problem with a worse failure: a 302 handed to one
 * kills the socket with nothing to read. And a machine client, which has no login page to be sent
 * to, gets the {@code WWW-Authenticate} challenge it can actually act on.
 *
 * <p><b>The socket beat is here rather than in the terminal story on purpose.</b> An upgrade takes
 * {@code EdgeWebSocketUpgrade}, the edge's own path, which never installs the interceptor chain —
 * it is the plane on which a forged identity used to cross this process. What proves the gate runs
 * before that path is a handshake that is refused: it is sent as a plain request carrying the
 * upgrade headers, so the refusal has a real status and draws as the plain 401 it was, rather than
 * as a socket that was never opened.

      """
      Behind this door every service believes `X-Qits-User` without checking it and has no
      authentication of its own. So the only thing a refusal can mean here is that the request
      never arrived — a 401 whose body had already reached the service would be a leak wearing a
      status code.

      Four callers with nothing to offer arrive, and each is refused in the shape it can act on.

      A browser navigating to a page is sent to the login page, carrying the name and the path it
      was trying to reach, so it can be put back where it was going.

      A background `fetch` from a tab that is already open cannot render a login page, and it gets
      a 401 with the page's address in the body — and deliberately **no** `WWW-Authenticate`
      header, because a browser answers a `Basic` challenge by popping its own credential dialog
      over whatever the person happens to be looking at.

      A WebSocket handshake is refused the same way, and this is the plane that matters most: an
      upgrade takes a path of its own through this process, one that skips the interceptor chain
      entirely, and it is the path a forged identity used to cross on. The refusal happens before
      any of it.

      A package client pushing a layer has no login page to be sent to at all, so it gets the
      `WWW-Authenticate` challenge it understands. Its name is one whose READS a deployment opened
      to everyone — which is exactly why the write is refused: opening reads is not publishing a
      service.

      And the diagram is the assertion. Four services were up and answering throughout. Not one
      arrow leaves this process.
