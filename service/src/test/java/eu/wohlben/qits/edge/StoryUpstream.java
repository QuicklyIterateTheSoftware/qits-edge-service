/**
 * <b>One service behind the edge, standing on a real port, recording what ARRIVED.</b>
 *
 * <p>This is the far side of every story in this catalogue, and the far side is where the evidence
 * is. What a story can see from in front of the edge is a status code; what a service behind it
 * would have BELIEVED is a header map, and only the receiver holds one. Every claim this repository
 * makes about the platform's trust model — the reserved namespace is emptied, an identity idp
 * vouched for is written in its place, a person's cookie does not reach a machine vhost, a name is
 * the whole routing decision — is a claim about bytes that arrived somewhere else.
 *
 * <h2>Why not {@code MockService}</h2>
 *
 * <p>qits-service-mock is the platform's generic recording stand-in and it is still used here: it
 * impersonates <b>qits-platform-idp</b>, whose whole contribution to these stories is a canned JSON
 * introspection answer, which is exactly what it is for. It cannot stand in for an APPLICATION
 * behind this service, on four counts, and each of them is a story:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>It cannot choose a response header.</b> {@code EdgeCacheControl} rewrites {@code
 *       Cache-Control: public, immutable, max-age=86400} into {@code no-cache} on everything whose
 *       name is not content-hashed — the fix that was lost when the gateway was retired and this
 *       process took its place. A stand-in that cannot SEND that header cannot be used to prove the
 *       edge corrects it.
 *   <li><b>It cannot answer with anything but JSON.</b> The document the rewrite exists for is an
 *       {@code index.html}.
 *   <li><b>It cannot answer over time.</b> {@code vertx-http-proxy} never buffers, which is the
 *       reason this service has the shape it has; a stand-in that writes its whole body at once
 *       makes a buffering proxy and a streaming one indistinguishable.
 *   <li><b>It cannot stop answering, and it cannot speak WebSocket.</b> An upstream that goes away
 *       mid-request is what a 502 is FOR, and an interactive terminal is the one plane on which a
 *       forged {@code X-Qits-User} used to cross this process ({@code EdgeWebSocketUpgrade} is the
 *       edge's own path and never runs the interceptor chain).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So the applications are Vert.x servers, for the same reason {@link StubGateways} is one: a JDK
 * {@code HttpServer} cannot do the WebSocket half at all.
 *
 * <h2>Two processes and more than one classloader</h2>
 *
 * <p>The server is dialled by the LAUNCHED artifact, a different process, so it has to be a real
 * socket on a real port. It is also started from a {@code QuarkusTestProfile}, which Quarkus
 * instantiates in more than one classloader — so a plain static singleton exists twice and the copy
 * a story arms is not the copy the application talks to. Both problems have the one answer this
 * platform already uses: the address is parked in a <b>system property</b>, the one namespace every
 * classloader in a JVM shares, and every mutation and every read is an HTTP call to the server
 * itself. The second instance is simply a client of the first.
 *
 * <h2>Recording discipline</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A request is recorded BEFORE it is answered</b> — including one that is never answered
 *       at all. The outage arm closes the connection with no status on the wire, and a recording
 *       written afterwards would miss precisely the exchange that story is about.
 *   <li><b>The recording is wiped when the server starts and never again.</b> {@link
 *       eu.wohlben.qits.userflows.NetworkCapture#source} attributes a cumulative recording with a
 *       cursor, and a reset mid-run would re-attribute traffic to whichever story drained next. One
 *       process, one recording, one cursor.
 *   <li><b>Every header is kept, and that is the point.</b> An allow-list could show that a header
 *       arrived and never that one did not, and "the forgery is not here" is the sharper half of
 *       every claim below.
 *   <li><b>The status is recorded beside the request</b>, because a diagram's label needs the
 *       answer, not the intention — and on a proxy the status is what says whether the hop happened
 *       at all.
 * </ul>
