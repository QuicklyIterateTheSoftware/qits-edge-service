/**
 * <b>The path on which the edge asserts NOTHING — and therefore the path on which the strip matters
 * most.</b>
 *
 * <p>{@code ForwardAuthBootstrapIT} proves the strip where there is something to put back: a
 * validated session's identity replaces whatever a client claimed. That is the reassuring half, and
 * it is not the half that broke. Two paths out of this process assert no identity at all — a
 * MACHINE credential, whose identity is inside its own token, and a read a deployment opened
 * through {@code qits.edge.auth.anonymous-read-apps}, where nobody has vouched for anybody. On
 * those paths there is no trusted value to write, so the temptation is to do nothing; and doing
 * nothing means a client-supplied {@code X-Qits-User} reaches a service that believes it
 * unconditionally.
 *
 * <p><b>That was the shape of the defect, and it is why the strip moved.</b> It used to live on the
 * session branch, which is exactly where it is least needed. It is now unconditional, in {@code
 * EdgeRouter.proxy}, at the one point every request leaves this process by — {@code
 * EdgeHeaders.applyIdentity(headers, null)} empties the reserved namespace and writes nothing back.
 * This story is that half, asserted from the far side, on the vhost where a caller really does
 * arrive with no credential at all.
 *
 * <p><b>And the cookie, which is the other direction of the same idea.</b> A session cookie set on
 * the parent domain is offered by the browser to every sibling name, by design — including the ones
 * no browser session belongs on. A registry, a mirror and a git host do not consume a person
 * session, so forwarding it there would turn a browser credential into a bearer any of those
 * services could see. {@code EdgeHeaders.stripCookie} removes that one pair and preserves every
 * other, and the only place that is checkable is a recording of what arrived.
 *
 * <p><b>The third beat is what keeps the exemption honest.</b> It is per app LABEL, so the same
 * request on a gated name is refused — the open read is one service's, not a path opened across the
 * environment.

      """
      Some names have to serve a caller who has nothing at all. Pulling a base image on a fresh
      node, cloning a public repository, fetching a dependency — each of them happens before there
      is anything to hold a credential, so a deployment can open the READS on a name by naming its
      app label. Everything that changes what the platform will run still needs a token.

      Which puts the reserved header namespace in an awkward spot. On an open read nobody has
      vouched for anybody, so the edge has no identity to write — and the tempting thing to do with
      no identity is nothing at all. Then a stranger's `X-Qits-User: admin` reaches, unaltered,
      a service that believes it without checking. That was the shape of it, and it is why the
      strip is now unconditional: it happens at the single point every request leaves this process
      by, whether or not there is anything to put in its place.

      So a machine asks the mirror for a manifest with no credential of any kind, stamping the
      three headers and a fourth nobody has invented yet. It is served — and the mirror's own
      recording shows the namespace arriving empty.

      Then a page that IS logged in fetches from the same name with a token of its own. The browser
      attaches the session cookie because the mirror is a sibling of the name she logged in on;
      that is browser design and nothing can stop it happening. What can be stopped is the cookie
      reaching a service that has no business with a person's credential — and the recording shows
      it gone, with her unrelated cookies untouched.

      Last, the same open read on a gated name. Refused. The exemption is one app label's, not a
      path opened across an environment.
