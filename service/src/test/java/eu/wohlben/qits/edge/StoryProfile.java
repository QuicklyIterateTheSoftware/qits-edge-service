/**
 * <b>One launched qits-platform-edge for the whole story catalogue</b>, and every seam a story
 * moves, declared once.
 *
 * <p>A {@code @TestProfile} is what failsafe launches a process for, so two profiles would be two
 * front doors — two boots, two databases, two session caches, two routing projections. Every story
 * class in this repository names this one; {@code ForwardAuthBootstrapIT} included, which is a
 * story class like the others and happens to be the oldest.
 *
 * <p><b>Every key here is a RUNTIME key.</b> A packaged process takes its configuration as {@code
 * -D} arguments on an artifact that was already built, so a build-time key would be silently
 * ignored and these stories would prove something other than what they say. Everything that makes
 * this service what it is stays exactly as it ships: the 1088M body ceiling, the one-hour idle
 * timeout that keeps terminals and SSE channels alive, the {@code /q} non-application root, the
 * OTel logging quartet, ACME off, and — above all — the {@code X-Qits-*} strip rule itself and the
 * {@code Cache-Control} rewrite, which are code and not configuration.
 *
 * <h2>What is configured, and why each one</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The two database triples</b> — the platform's generic resource contract, which
 *       qits-platform-deployments injects and the shipped datasource expressions read with no
 *       defaults on purpose. {@code edge} is the routing projection; {@code eventstream} is
 *       qits-eventstream's claim ledger, and it is needed even though the bus is dark below,
 *       because dark does not mean absent: Quarkus opens the connection and runs Flyway at boot
 *       regardless. Both are databases of this catalogue's own on the same embedded postgres the
 *       surefire suite spawns, so a launched process and any suite can never mean the same schema.
 *       Their urls are carried through system properties rather than static fields, because a test
 *       profile is instantiated in more than one classloader and a field written by one copy is not
 *       the field another reads.
 *   <li><b>The environment list and FOUR application vhosts</b> — the deployment's own inputs,
 *       stated exactly as {@code QITS_EDGE_ENVIRONMENTS} and {@code
 *       QITS_EDGE_APPS_<APP>_HOST_PATTERN} state them. Each {@code host-pattern} is a name nothing
 *       resolves and each {@code hosts.dev} override is the stand-in's real address: a request that
 *       reached the pattern would be a resolution bug rather than a test that happened to pass.
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>{@code projects} and {@code docs} are two ordinary services, gated identically, and
 *             they exist as a PAIR: they answer the same paths, so which of them received a request
 *             is the whole of what a Host name decided.
 *         <li>{@code mirror} is a MACHINE vhost whose reads a deployment opened. No browser talks
 *             to it, which makes it the name on which a person's cookie must not arrive.
 *         <li>{@code offline} is configured, routed, and points at a port nothing listens on. That
 *             is precisely NOT the same as a name nobody claims: this one is somebody's, and the
 *             somebody is not there.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li><b>The browser gate</b> — the flag this service ships DARK, plus the credential and the
 *       origins that make it legal to turn on. This is the point of the whole run: with the flag
 *       false a request takes the path it took before the gate existed, and most of what is below
 *       would not be under test.
 *   <li><b>Four neutralisations.</b> The event bus is dark and its address is a closed port, so a
 *       projection this run does not use cannot spend it dialling {@code qits-events}, a name that
 *       resolves on qits-net and nowhere else. The startup catch-up barrier is off, which is the
 *       code's own escape hatch for a deliberately offline setup and the same line the suite's
 *       properties file carries — with it on, every request answers 503 while a bus that is not
 *       there is waited for. And OTel is dark, like {@code %dev}/{@code %test}: the shipped
 *       exporter points at {@code http://dev-qits-observability:8080}, another qits-net-only name.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>The deployment projection is deliberately absent</h2>
 *
 * <p>A name reaches a service two ways: {@code qits.edge.apps}, which is configuration, and the
 * projection, which is rebuilt from qits-events at boot. Only the first survives into a launched
 * process without a bus, and these stories are about what the edge does WITH a request rather than
 * about how it learnt the route. {@code qits.edge.projection.catchup.required=false} is the escape
 * hatch the code carries for exactly that.
 *
 * <p>One consequence is load-bearing and is worth stating rather than discovering: with no
 * published host, every vhost here is a CONFIGURED one, and {@code EdgeRouter.handle} routes any
 * target for which {@code Target.service()} holds — which {@code route.toApp()} alone satisfies —
 * into {@code serviceGate}. So a configured vhost carrying a session cookie is introspected,
 * stripped and stamped exactly like a published one. {@code EdgeSessions}' class javadoc says the
 * opposite; the code is what these stories rely on, and the two sentences do not agree.
