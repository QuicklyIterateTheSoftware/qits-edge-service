/**
 * The whole service as it is <b>packaged</b>, with the browser gate ON, in front of a service that
 * records what arrived — the one posture this repository's suite has never had, and the only one in
 * which the platform's central trust claim is a fact rather than a sentence.
 *
 * <p>That claim is the reason this file exists, and it is the oldest class of this catalogue. Half
 * the fleet's CLAUDE.md files say some version of "the edge asserts {@code X-Qits-User} / {@code
 * X-Qits-User-Id} / {@code X-Qits-Roles} and every service behind it believes them
 * unconditionally", and each of those services tests the BELIEVING half against headers its own
 * suite wrote. Nobody tests the ASSERTING half except this repository, and until this catalogue
 * existed it did so with {@code @QuarkusTest} alone: {@code EdgeSessionGateTest} proves the
 * strip-then-inject against in-process stub upstreams inside the same JVM as the router. What only
 * a launched process has is this:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The gate is a boot-time decision, and this is the boot that makes it.</b> {@code
 *       qits.edge.sessions.enabled} ships <b>false</b> — deliberately, so the gate lands inert and
 *       is flipped as a release step of its own — and {@code EdgeSessions#requireItsOwnCredential}
 *       refuses to start a process that turns it on with no idp client to introspect with. A
 *       {@code @QuarkusTest} flips a flag in an application it is already inside; here the flag,
 *       the credential and the startup check are handed to an artifact that was already built, as
 *       {@code -D} arguments, exactly as a deployment hands them over.
 *   <li><b>The strip is asserted from the OTHER side of the wire.</b> The upstream is a {@link
 *       StoryUpstream}, a separate process' worth of separation from the router: what it recorded
 *       is what a real service would have believed. An in-process stub and a real proxied socket
 *       are the same assertion right up until {@code vertx-http-proxy} copies a header map, and
 *       copying the header map is the whole subject.
 *   <li><b>The refusals are the real ones.</b> No dev-user, no synthetic identity, no test security
 *       — the launched process authenticates a cookie against idp or it refuses, and the two shapes
 *       of refusal (the login redirect a browser can follow, the {@code WWW-Authenticate} challenge
 *       docker acts on) are what a caller outside the platform actually receives.
 *   <li><b>Health and the door answer before any of it.</b> Both are properties of route ORDER in a
 *       booted Vert.x router — {@code EdgeRouter.ROUTE_ORDER} and the explicit {@code /q} skip —
 *       and a packaged process is where an ordering mistake would show.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>This class runs FIRST, and that is load-bearing.</b> A cumulative recording is attributed
 * by a cursor, so anything the launched process asked its far side before a story ran lands in
 * whichever story drains first. Every other story in the catalogue carries
 * {@code @UserflowRunsAfter(ForwardAuthBootstrapIT.class)} so that whatever a boot produces belongs
 * to the story that is about the boot.
 *
 * <p><b>What is NOT under test here, and must not be read into these two reports.</b> The strip
 * proven below is the one on the path where the edge <i>asserts an identity of its own</i> — a
 * validated browser session. The two paths that assert none — a MACHINE credential, and a read a
 * deployment opened through {@code qits.edge.auth.anonymous-read-apps} — strip the namespace too
 * and assert nothing into it, and that is {@code AnonymousReadIT}'s subject rather than this one's.
 * It is worth saying which way round it is: the strip is <b>unconditional</b> since it moved into
 * {@code EdgeRouter.proxy}, because the strip is the whole basis of a forward-auth service's trust
 * and cannot depend on there being a session to replace the value with.
 *
 * <p><b>The far side is two recorders, and they are two KINDS of recorder.</b> One is a {@link
 * StoryUpstream} impersonating <b>qits-projects</b> — a Vert.x server, because the stories in this
 * catalogue need response headers, non-JSON bodies, chunked answers, an outage arm and a WebSocket
 * upgrade, none of which a canned-JSON stand-in can do. The other is qits-service-mock's {@code
 * MockService} standing in for <b>qits-platform-idp</b>, which is exactly what that library is for:
 * one canned JSON answer per route, recorded. What the idp mock cannot stand in for is telling one
 * cookie from another — a canned stub answers every token the same way — and it does not need to:
 * {@code EdgeSessionGateTest}'s stub idp carries three sessions, a revocation and an outage, and
 * pins that half against the suite's own JVM. What is proven here and nowhere else is that a
 * launched artifact asks at all, over a real socket, with the credential a deployment gave it.
 *
 * <p><b>The requests are driven by {@link EdgeClient} rather than by rest-assured</b>, for the
 * reason written on that class: this service routes on {@code Host}, and rest-assured derives that
 * header from the URL it was given. rest-assured is used for the health probe alone, where the name
 * genuinely does not matter.
 *
 * <p><b>An absence is never an edge.</b> "The refused request never reached the service" is the
 * sharpest claim in this file and it is a claim about traffic that did NOT happen — the diagram can
 * only draw traffic that did. It stays exactly what it is: a count over the upstream's own
 * recording, with a note beside it. Read the two graphs together and the absence is legible anyway:
 * four requests arrive at the edge in the first story and only two leave it.

  @UserStoryDescription(
      """
      Every service on this platform believes three headers without checking them: `X-Qits-User`,
      `X-Qits-User-Id` and `X-Qits-Roles` say who a caller is, and there is no second opinion
      anywhere behind this process. That is a sound arrangement and a cheap one, and it rests
      entirely on one property of the front door — that the door writes those headers and a client
      cannot.

      So the story is told from the far side. A stranger asks a service host for a page and stamps
      the three headers on the request herself, hoping the edge passes them along. She is refused
      twice over, in the two shapes a caller can act on: a browser navigating is sent to the login
      page with the name and path it was trying to reach, and a machine client with no session to
      offer gets the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge `docker` reads — Bearer first, because docker
      acts on the first scheme it recognises, and Basic behind it, because maven and npm will only
      spend credentials against a scheme they implement. Neither request reaches the service at
      all, which is the part only the service's own recording can say.

      Then she logs in, and sends exactly the same forged headers with the cookie. This time the
      request is served — and the service is told she is the person idp vouched for, not the
      administrator she claimed to be. Her three forgeries are gone, and so is a fourth header
      nobody has invented yet: the rule is the reserved prefix rather than a list of names, because
      a list is a thing somebody extends a day late.

      What makes the identity real is that the edge does not decide it. The cookie is opaque — 256
      random bits, stored hashed at idp — so this process asks, over a socket, presenting its own
      client credential, because an introspection endpoint anyone could call would be an oracle
      about everybody's session. And it asks ONCE for a browser that keeps browsing: every image
      and every poll carries the same cookie, so a gate that asked every time would put idp on the
      path of every request a logged-in person makes.

      The other half of a guarded front door: what it must keep answering to callers it knows
      nothing about, and what it must refuse to answer to anybody at all.

      An environment's own name is a DOOR, and a door serves nothing. Every service on the platform
      is reached on its own name now, so a route, an API or a wire protocol offered on the
      environment's name would be a second address for something that already has one — a second
      origin, a second cookie scope, a second thing to keep in step. So it routes nothing and it
      gates nothing, because there is nothing behind it to gate: the same name answers 404 to a
      stranger and 404 to a person holding a perfectly good session, and the message it answers
      with is the useful part — it names the shape every service is actually on. Nothing reaches an
      upstream from there, with or without a credential.

      An app-shaped name nobody claims is a different 404, and it matters that it is one at all. A
      name of the form `<app>.<env>.<domain>` was aimed at a service, and services are the names
      this process authenticates — so a mistyped or decommissioned one has to fail here. Falling
      through to something that serves it would hand exactly those requests to the hop that does
      not check them.

      And the one surface that stays open to everyone, on every name: this process's own health.
      An orchestrator carries no session and can never be given one, so a readiness probe that
      redirected to a login page would be a container that never comes up — and this is the
      container that binds the host's only published port, so nothing on the platform would come up
      behind it. It is answered by this process rather than proxied, whatever Host the probe used,
      and it says what a booted edge is ready FOR: a deployment routing projection it has caught up
