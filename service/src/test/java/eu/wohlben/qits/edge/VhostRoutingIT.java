/**
 * <b>The one decision this process makes before it makes any other: which service a request is
 * for.</b>
 *
 * <p>It is made from the {@code Host} header and from nothing else. There is no route table beyond
 * the application list and the deployment projection, no path is rewritten, no body is read — a
 * name selects an <i>index into a fixed list</i> and never contributes a character to an address,
 * which is the whole SSRF guard. Everything else in this catalogue happens downstream of this
 * decision, and every one of those stories would still pass if the edge sent every request to the
 * same place. This is the one that says it does not.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is why the far side is TWO ordinary services rather than one.</b> "The request
 * reached a service" is a status code; "the request reached <i>this</i> service and not that one"
 * is only sayable if there is a that one, and only provable on the receiver's own recording. So
 * {@code qits-projects} and {@code qits-docs} are published identically, gated identically, and
 * both answer the same path — and the story asks for that path on both names with the same cookie,
 * so the name is the only thing that differs between the two requests.
 *
 * <p><b>The third name is the one that shows a path is not a route.</b> {@code
 * mirror.dev.acme.example.com} is a machine vhost, and it has no such path: the 404 the caller gets
 * is the MIRROR's own, generated one hop further in, not a refusal by the edge. On a path-routed
 * proxy that request would have been recognised and sent to whoever owns {@code /projects}; here
 * nobody owns a path at all.
 *
 * <p><b>This is also why every label in this catalogue carries the vhost.</b> Two of the three
 * requests below are byte-identical apart from one header. A label built from the method and the
 * path would draw them as one arrow, and the difference between them is the entire subject.

  @UserStoryDescription(
      """
      Every service on this platform is reached on a name of its own — `<app>.<env>.<domain>` — and
      the front door does exactly one thing with that name: it looks it up. There is no path
      knowledge in this process at all. It does not know that `/projects/api` belongs to
      qits-projects, and it must not: a name selects an index into a fixed list, so there is no
      string a client can send that reaches a host nobody configured.

      The story is one person following one link and then another, and a third caller who is not a
      person. She asks `tracker.dev.acme.example.com` for a version, and qits-projects answers. She
      follows a link to `docs.dev.acme.example.com` and asks for **the same path**, with the same
      cookie, from the same browser — and a completely different process answers, which is a fact
      neither of the two status codes can tell you and both of the recordings can.

      Then a package client asks the mirror's name for that same path. The mirror is a real service
      and it is reached, and it has never heard of that route — so the 404 comes back from one hop
      further in, with the mirror's own words in it. That is the difference a path-routed proxy
      cannot draw: there, the request would have been recognised and handed to whoever owns
      `/projects`. Here nobody owns a path.

      One cookie, one introspection: the edge asked idp about her once and served both of her reads
      from the belief it bought, because the two names are two services and one person.
