/**
 * THE ISSUER AND THE ADDRESS ARE TWO FACTS, and these are the assertions that keep them apart.
 *
 * <p>Deleting the platform plane moved the idp from its bare alias to {@code <env>-<application>}.
 * The edge had one key for both jobs, so moving the address would have moved the {@code iss} claim
 * with it — and that claim is compared for equality by every consumer on the estate, so changing it
 * rejects every token in flight at once. The split is what lets the dial address follow the
 * deployment while the claim stays exactly where it is.
 *
 * <p>These tests are written to FAIL if anybody re-merges the two keys: every one of them sets the
 * two to different hosts and asserts which of them each answer is built from. On a platform that
 * has not cut over the two hold the same string, so a collapsed implementation would pass every
 * integration suite in this repository and be discovered on the estate.
