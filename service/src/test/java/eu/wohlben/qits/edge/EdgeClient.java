/**
 * A client that can say whatever it likes in the {@code Host} header — which is the whole of what
 * this service routes on, so the suite needs one.
 *
 * <p>Vert.x rather than RestAssured or the JDK client, and that is not a preference: RestAssured
 * derives {@code Host} from the URL it was given, and the JDK's {@code HttpClient} lists {@code
 * Host} among the headers an application may not set at all.
 *
 * <p>Vert.x separates the two ideas an edge test needs kept apart: {@code setServer} is where the
 * socket goes, {@code setHost} is what the request says. So an ordinary request states any name at
 * all while still landing on loopback, with no DNS involved.
 *
 * <p><b>A WebSocket handshake is the exception, and it uses the JDK client instead.</b> Vert.x
 * <i>ignores</i> {@code setServer} on {@code HttpClient.webSocket} and resolves the name for real,
 * so every socket test died on {@code UnknownHostException} while the plain requests passed
 * (measured on Vert.x 4.5.26). The JDK's builder will send a chosen {@code Host}, but only with
 * {@code jdk.httpclient.allowRestrictedHeaders=host} — which the surefire configuration in pom.xml
 * sets, and without which these tests fail with an {@code IllegalArgumentException} on the header
 * name rather than on anything about this service.
 *
 * <p><b>It is also the incoming tap of {@code ForwardAuthBootstrapIT}'s network diagram.</b> Every
 * sibling service taps its userflow with a RestAssured filter; here that is impossible for the same
 * reason this class exists at all — rest-assured cannot say {@code Host}, so nothing a story sends
 * goes through it. {@link #sending} is the one funnel every ordinary request passes, so the
 * observation lives there. Three things about it:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The vhost is in the label, not just the path.</b> On this service a name is not
 *       decoration — it IS the routing decision, and {@code GET /projects/api/me} means one thing
 *       on a service host and a 404 on the environment door. A label that dropped it would draw
 *       those as one arrow.
 *   <li><b>The initiator is the story's, never the request's.</b> A stranger's browser, a machine
 *       client with no credential and a logged-in person differ by headers a diagram must not print
 *       — and telling them apart is the entire subject. {@link NetworkCapture#actor()} is read when
 *       the request is BUILT, not when the answer arrives, because the answer arrives on a Vert.x
 *       thread at a moment the story does not control.
 *   <li><b>Only answers are observed.</b> A request that failed to get one is not an edge with an
 *       unknown status; it is a test that broke, and {@link #await} says so. That rule now covers
 *       three planes rather than one: {@link #stream} observes its exchange once the whole body has
 *       landed, and {@link #handshake} observes the dial only once the {@code 101} is in hand and
 *       the frame only once it has arrived. A refused upgrade therefore records nothing at all,
 *       which is what stops an "attached" arrow being drawn for a socket that was never opened.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>All three observations are made on the STORY's own thread</b>, at the point the waiting
 * returned, and never from a Vert.x or JDK callback: {@link NetworkCapture#actor()} is a sticky
 * value the framework resets at every story border, so a callback firing after that border would
 * attribute an edge to the wrong story. The one place that cannot wait — {@link #sending}, whose
 * whole purpose is a request in flight — reads the actor when the request is BUILT and observes
 * before the future completes, which comes to the same guarantee.
 *
 * <p>Nothing about this costs the ordinary {@code @QuarkusTest}s that use this class anything: the
 * capture registry is a JVM-global list that only a running {@code @UserStory} ever drains, so
 * outside a story the observations are recorded and never read.
