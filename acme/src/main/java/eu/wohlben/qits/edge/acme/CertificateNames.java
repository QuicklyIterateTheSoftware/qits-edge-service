/**
 * The finite wildcard set that covers the edge's public host-name shapes, plus the names that shape
 * cannot reach.
 *
 * <p><b>The grammar is read RIGHT TO LEFT, and every label is inside the one to its right:</b>
 * {@code <app>[.<env>].<project>.<domain>}. The domain holds projects, a project holds its
 * environments, an environment holds its apps. There is no unqualified application tier — a project
 * label is always there — and there is no environment tier at the top: {@code dev.wohlben.eu} is
 * not a name, because an environment only exists inside a project.
 *
 * <p><b>A wildcard is leftmost-only and covers exactly one label.</b> That is the whole arithmetic
 * of this class: a name is covered only when every label but the leftmost one is spelled out. The
 * derived set therefore has FOUR tiers, and each of them exists because the tier above it stops one
 * label short:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the apex — {@code wohlben.eu}, and nothing under it;
 *   <li>{@code *.<domain>} — every project's own door, {@code acme.wohlben.eu}, and only one label
 *       deep;
 *   <li>{@code *.<project>.<domain>} per known project — one name per project, and what it covers
 *       depends on whether that project has environments. For an ENV-LESS project it is the tier
 *       its applications are served on: {@code projects.qits.wohlben.eu}. For a project that DOES
 *       support environments it is the tier its environment doors are served on: {@code
 *       dev.acme.wohlben.eu}. Either way it is served, not merely resolved;
 *   <li>{@code *.<environment>.<project>.<domain>} per env-supporting project and environment — one
 *       application of one project in one environment, {@code ci.dev.acme.wohlben.eu}. An env-less
 *       project contributes none of these at all, because it has no middle label to spell out.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Which projects have environments is a projection, not a guess.</b> The {@code projects}
 * argument is a map of slug to that flag, fed from the edge's own project projection, so an estate
 * of env-less projects costs {@code 2 + P} names where the old top-level environment tier and the
 * unconditional cross product cost {@code 2 + E + P + P·E}.
 *
 * <p><b>The project tiers retire the extra-SAN-per-project debt.</b> A project's host used to reach
 * this certificate only by being written out by hand, one {@code additional} name per project, in a
 * bootstrap key a person had to remember to extend — so a project created on Tuesday had no
 * certificate until somebody edited a deployment. The projects are now fed in from the {@code
 * ProjectCreated}/{@code ProjectDeleted} events qits-projects publishes, and a slug that is on this
 * list is covered at every depth it can be served on by construction.
 *
 * <p><b>The additional names remain a list of NAMES</b> — "also these", not "also every project's
 * host". They arrive from the bootstrap as {@code QITS_EDGE_ACME_ADDITIONAL_NAMES}, written whole
 * or relative to the domain, because one line is what a person writes: {@code status.acme} and
 * {@code status.acme.wohlben.eu} are the same name when the domain is {@code wohlben.eu}. Every one
 * of them ends up inside the domain, and that is not a courtesy — the edge answers its challenges
 * by writing records in this domain's own zone, so a name outside it is an order that cannot be
 * answered, and one such name fails the WHOLE order.
 *
 * <p><b>Past the ceiling the project tiers are DROPPED, never the order.</b> See {@link
 * #capped(String, Collection, Map, Collection)}: the set an over-large estate produces is short of
 * some projects, and it is still an orderable set, because the alternative — the refusal this class
 * used to raise — took the whole reconcile with it, expiry renewal included. The ceiling is further
 * off than it was — ninety-eight env-less projects rather than twenty-four on a three-environment
 * edge — and it is still reachable, so the drop policy stays exactly as it is.
 *
 * <p>Empty projects and an empty additional list are the ordinary platform and leave the derived
 * set exactly as it was.

   * one project over could no longer renew an EXPIRING certificate either, and the platform's only
   * TLS terminator went dark ninety days later. Projects are therefore dropped until the set fits:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>in the slugs' sorted order, from the END, so the same estate always drops the same slugs
   *       and yesterday's certificate is not reshuffled by today's ordering;
   *   <li>a WHOLE project at a time — its {@code *.<slug>.<domain>} and every {@code
   *       *.<env>.<slug>.<domain>} go together, because half a project on a certificate is an
   *       origin that answers in one environment and fails the handshake in the next;
   *   <li>never the apex, {@code *.<domain>} or an additional name. Those are what the platform
   *       itself answers on, and they are configuration rather than a projection that grew — so
